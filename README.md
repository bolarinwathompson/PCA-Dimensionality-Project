# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for ABC Grocery

## Project Overview:
The **ABC Grocery PCA** project uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of customer transaction data while retaining the most important features. This project helps to identify patterns and structure in high-dimensional data, allowing ABC Grocery to visualize customer behavior, identify key drivers, and enhance data processing efficiency.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to apply **PCA** to customer transaction data to reduce the number of features and highlight the most significant factors driving customer behavior. By reducing dimensionality, we simplify the data for better analysis and modeling, helping ABC Grocery streamline customer segmentation, inventory management, and marketing strategies.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and the data is normalized to ensure fair comparison between features.
- **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: **PCA** is used to transform the dataset, reducing the number of features while retaining as much variance as possible.
- **Variance Explained**: The project visualizes the proportion of variance explained by each principal component to determine how many components are needed for optimal performance.
- **Data Visualization**: The project visualizes the explained variance and cumulative variance to identify the number of principal components that best represent the dataset.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: After dimensionality reduction, a **Random Forest classifier** is used to predict customer behavior based on the transformed data, helping ABC Grocery classify customers effectively.

## Methods & Techniques:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**:
The dataset is first cleaned and preprocessed:
- **Missing Data Handling**: Missing values are detected and removed.
- **Feature Scaling**: **StandardScaler** is applied to standardize the features, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the PCA transformation.

### **2. Applying PCA**:
- **Explained Variance**: PCA is applied to the data, and the explained variance ratio is computed for each principal component. This allows us to understand how much information each component captures from the original data.
- **Cumulative Variance**: The cumulative variance across the components is plotted to determine how many components are required to retain a sufficient amount of information.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied with the goal of retaining 75% of the variance in the data. This reduces the number of features significantly while keeping the data informative.

### **3. Model Training**:
Once dimensionality reduction is completed, a **Random Forest classifier** is trained on the transformed data to classify customer behavior (such as whether they are likely to sign up for promotions or not).

### **4. Model Evaluation**:
The model's accuracy is evaluated using the **accuracy score**, and predictions are compared against actual outcomes to assess the model’s effectiveness.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation, PCA, and model training.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing **PCA**, **Random Forest classifier**, and **StandardScaler**.
- **pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing the explained variance and cumulative variance of the PCA components.

## Key Results & Outcomes:
- PCA effectively reduced the dimensionality of the dataset, capturing most of the information in fewer components.
- The **Random Forest classifier** achieved a high accuracy score on the transformed data, indicating that dimensionality reduction did not harm the model’s predictive power.
- Visualizing the **explained variance** helped identify the number of components necessary to retain a significant amount of the original data’s variance.

## Lessons Learned:
- **PCA** is a powerful tool for simplifying complex, high-dimensional datasets, making them easier to work with and visualize.
- **Feature scaling** is essential when performing PCA, as it ensures that each feature is given equal weight in the transformation process.
- **Random Forest** can be an effective model for classification tasks, even after dimensionality reduction, provided that the features retain enough information.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the **Random Forest classifier** parameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth) could improve model performance.
- **Advanced PCA**: Implementing **Kernel PCA** or **Sparse PCA** could handle non-linear relationships or increase sparsity for even more efficient data representation.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Deploying the trained model into a real-time system to classify customers as new data is processed.
